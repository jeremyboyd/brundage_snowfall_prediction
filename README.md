# LSTM models predicting snowfall at Brundage Mountain and Snowbird

This project uses deep learning to explore [the idea that weather buoy behavior north of Kauai can predict snowfall two weeks later in the intermountain west](https://powderbuoy.com/what-is-a-buoypop-101/). NOAA buoy wave height data is combined with other meteorological time series (e.g., temperature, pressure, precipitation) to predict snowfall at Brundage Mountain, Idaho, and Snowbird, Utah.
