The authors claim that activity at a specific weather buoy northwest of Kauai can predict snowstorms in Utah and other Mountain West locations. Specifically, if there's a buoy pop--i.e., if wave height measured at the buoy suddenly increases--this predicts snow in Utah two weeks later.

I've been a skier and snowboarder since I was a kid. When I heard about this idea I was super excited. It's basically a method for doing long term snowfall forcasts which, if accurate, would allow you to plan time off from work in order to be on the mountain when big storms hit.




This project uses deep learning to explore [the idea that weather buoy behavior north of Kauai can predict snowfall two weeks later in the intermountain west](https://powderbuoy.com/what-is-a-buoypop-101/). NOAA buoy wave height data is combined with other meteorological time series (e.g., temperature, pressure, precipitation) to predict snowfall at Brundage Mountain, Idaho, and Snowbird, Utah.
